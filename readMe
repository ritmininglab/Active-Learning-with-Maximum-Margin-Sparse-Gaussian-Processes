SGPKMC:
The class SGPKMC is the base estimator that implements the proposed MM-SGP.
The implementation of MM-SGP follows scikit-learn API for base.estimator. The standard methods (fit,predict,predict_proba,score) can be found in:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.BaseEstimator.html#sklearn.base.BaseEstimator
	Customized methods:
	get_activeSet(): 
		paras:X: the origin training set.
			  method: ['kmean','FITC','VFE'] method to get the active set. Default is 'kmean' 
			  sparseRate: [0~1] double. Control the sparsity of the active set.
		retrun X_hat. the active set
		
	predict_var():
		paras:X_test, test dataset.
			  useAug:boolean. Whether to use augmented set for variance prediction or not.
			  anchor: augmented set.
			  sampleSize:int. Number of samples in MCMC sampling.
		retrun X_var. The predicted variance of X_test 
SGPMED_AL():
The active learning method that adopt MM-SGP as active learner.
	X: the origin training set.
	Y: class labels.
	train_ind,candidate_ind,test_ind: train/candidate/test index
	sparseThres: int. MM-SGP seeks sparse approximation with training size no smaller than sparseThres.
	decayThres: After decayThres iterations AL start to decay eta.
	sparseRate: sparse rate for MM-SGP
	rbf_scale: kernel length scale. If kernel='rbf' this is the length scale, if kernel='linear', this 	
	is the bias term.
	Niter: number of active learning iterations.
	Return: list of test accuracy
